# Todo List React Application

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to manage state in a React functional component using the `useState` hook. The application includes functionality for adding and managing todo items, with separate sections for input fields, todo headings, and lists.

## Key Features

- **State Management:** Utilizes React's `useState` hook to manage the state of todo items, input fields, and list items.
- **Dynamic Rendering:** Renders todo headings and their associated lists based on the component’s state.
- **Event Handling:** Implements functions for adding new todos and lists, and updating the state in response to user input.
- **Modular Structure:** Organizes code into distinct sections for better readability and maintainability, including input handling, todo display, and list management.

## Conclusion

I have effectively manage and display dynamic data in a React application. By using the `useState` hook and structuring the component into modular sections, I’ve built a functional and maintainable Todo List application.
